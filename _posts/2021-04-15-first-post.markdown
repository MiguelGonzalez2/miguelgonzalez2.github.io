Hi! My name is Miguel González and I'm currently studying a Double Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid.

In this website, I will publish some of my personal projects in the [projects]({% link projects.markdown %}) section. I also intend on writing blog posts, mainly about mathematical ideas that I found interesting during my learning process.

You can find more about me in the [about]({% link about.markdown %}) page.
