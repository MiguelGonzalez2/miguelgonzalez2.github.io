### ApunTeX - Mathematics Course Notes (in Spanish)

These are my revised class notes (in Spanish) from lectures I attended as part of my Degree in Mathematics. Before being published here, I revised them individually, adding a cover image, a summary page and short explanatory paragraphs where I felt they were needed.

These documents **are**:

- A direct an ordered collection of the most importat definitions and results from the subject in question, at undergraduate level.
- A collection of full proofs of said results (except in the most basic cases).
- A _guide_ to quickly review previously acquired ideas, or to check specific aspects that might have not been fully understood at first.

These documents **are NOT**:

- A textbook.
- A collection of exercises to practice your knowledge.
- A list of examples to illustrate the ideas presented. Sometimes, particular examples are included when they can be fruitful or interesting, but they're not the point of these notes and, as such, they're very sparse, in favor of the first bullet point of the previous list.

### 50!Mania - A DDR-like rhythm game in Lua

50!Mania is a rythm-based DDR-like game such as stepmania or osu!mania made with LOVE (2D), made by Miguel Gonzalez. The game audio was made by Kevin McLeod from incompetech as part of his royalty-free music library. Showcase video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POeyXxUaCU0). This was done as a final project for Harvard's CS50G Introduction to Game Development, which I took as a MOOC on edX.
