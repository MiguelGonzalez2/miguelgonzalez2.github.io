Hi! My name is Miguel Gonz치lez and I'm currently studying my Master's Degree in Advanced Mathematics at Universidad Aut칩noma de Madrid (Spain) with the support of a grant from Instituto de Ciencias Matem치ticas (ICMAT). My bachelor was a Double Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at Universidad Aut칩noma de Madrid (Spain). My mathematical interests are differential/algebraic geometry, topology and moduli spaces of geometric structures such as vector bundles and Higgs bundles. 

In this website, you will find some of my publications in the [projects]({% link projects.markdown %}) section. These include the _ApunTeX_, which are my revised class notes (in Spanish) from mathematics lectures I attended in college, and that I hope will help future students. I also intend on writing blog posts, mainly about mathematical ideas that I found interesting during my learning process.

You can contact me at my [email adress](mailto:mgonzalez.contacto@gmail.com), and find more about my career at [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/MiguelGonzalezGonzalez).
