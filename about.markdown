Hi! My name is Miguel González and I'm currently studying a Double Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. I'm interested in pure mathematics topics, such as Topology, Differential Geometry, Abstract Algebra and Galois Theory. My main hobby is playing videogames.

I have also participated in several academic competitions, such as the [49th International Chemisty Olympiad](http://www.icho-official.org/results/results.php?id=49&year=2017), in which I got a bronze medal.

In this website, I will publish some of my personal projects in the [projects]({% link projects.markdown %}) section. I also intend on writing blog posts, mainly about mathematical ideas that I found interesting during my learning process.

You can contact me at my [email adress](mailto:mgonzalez.contacto@gmail.com), and find more about my career at [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/MiguelGonzalezGonzalez).
