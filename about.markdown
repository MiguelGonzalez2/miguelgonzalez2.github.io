Hi! My name is Miguel González and I'm currently studying my Master's Degree in Advanced Mathematics at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (Spain) with the support of a grant from Instituto de Ciencias Matemáticas (ICMAT). My bachelor was a Double Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (Spain). My mathematical interests are differential/algebraic geometry, topology and moduli spaces of geometric structures such as vector bundles and Higgs bundles. 

In this website, I will publish some of my personal projects in the [projects]({% link projects.markdown %}) section. These projects include the _ApunTeX_, which are my revised class notes (in Spanish) from mathematics lectures I attended in college, and that I hope will help future students. I also intend on writing blog posts, mainly about mathematical ideas that I found interesting during my learning process.

You can contact me at my [email adress](mailto:mgonzalez.contacto@gmail.com), and find more about my career at [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/MiguelGonzalezGonzalez).

My main hobbies are playing videogames and, as of recently, self-learning Japanese (一年ぐらい前に始めた！). I have also participated in several academic competitions, such as the [49th International Chemistry Olympiad](http://www.icho-official.org/results/results.php?id=49&year=2017), in which I got a bronze medal.
