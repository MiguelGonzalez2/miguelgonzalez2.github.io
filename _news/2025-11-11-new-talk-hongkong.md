In the last couple of weeks I have visited The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) and participated in the [MIST Conference in Mathematical Physics](http://www.ims.cuhk.edu.hk/activities/conferences/mist/2025/mist_conference_lecture_21oct-8nov2025/), where I gave a talk titled _Very stable G-Higgs bundles and Hecke modifications_. After that, I participated as a young scientist in the [Hong Kong Laureate Forum 2025](https://hklaureateforum.org/en/), where I presented [a poster](/assets/pdf//publications/HKLF2025.pdf) titled _Very stable $G$-Higgs bundles_. Check out [my research page](/publications) to find more about my talks, posters and publications.
