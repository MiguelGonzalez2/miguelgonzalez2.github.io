From September 30th to October 1st I will attend the [2024 Clay Research Conference workshop: The P=W Conjecture in Non Abelian Hodge Theory](https://www.claymath.org/events/the-pw-conjecture-in-non-abelian-hodge-theory/) organised by the Clay Mathematics Institute at the Mathematical Institute, Oxford.
