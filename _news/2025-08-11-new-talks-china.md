During my 2025 visit to China I have given two new talks on different projects. The first one is about joint work in progress with [Oscar García-Prada](https://www.icmat.es/miembros/garcia-prada/) and [Junming Zhang](https://llddeddym.github.io/), titled _Compact components in relative character varieties for real lie groups of Hermitian type_, at the [Geometry Workshop of the Hitchin-Ngô Laboratory](https://www.icmat.es/severo-ochoa/icmat-laboratories/2024-2028/hitchin-ngo/) hosted by [Feishu](https://www.feishu.ca/) in Shanghai. The second one is about recent progress on very stable Higgs bundles, titled _A criterion for wobbliness of parabolic G-Higgs bundles_, at the [seminar of the Chern Institute for Mathematics, Nankai University](http://en.cim.nankai.edu.cn/info/1048/3160.htm) in Tianjin. Check [my research page](/publications) for a full list of my talks.
