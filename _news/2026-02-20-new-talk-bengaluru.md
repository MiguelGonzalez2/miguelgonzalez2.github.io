I am currently participating in the [Geometric Structures and Stability](https://www.icts.res.in/program/stability) research program at the [International Centre for Theroetical Sciences (ICTS-TIFR)](https://icts.res.in) in Bengaluru. I have presented a talk titled _Wobbly parabolic G-Higgs bundles and affine flag varieties_ on new work to appear soon. More information, including the talk slides and video, can be found in [my research page](/publications).
